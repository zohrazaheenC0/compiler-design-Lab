Compiler Design Programs

This repository contains Lex, Yacc, and C programs related to compiler design.
The programs are divided into two folders:

🧩 1. Lab-Programs

These programs cover lexical analysis, parsing, and code generation.

Program	Description
Program1.l	Identifies valid identifiers in input.\n
Program2.l	Recognizes C keywords.
Program3.l	Classifies operators (arithmetic, relational, logical, etc.).
Program4.l	Identifies constants, comments, identifiers, and operators.
Program5.l	Distinguishes vowels and consonants.
Program6.l	Detects functions and comments in C.
Program7.c	Top-down parser using backtracking.
Program8.c	Recursive descent parser for arithmetic expressions.
Program9.c	Recursive descent parser for lists and parentheses.
Program10.c	Computes FIRST sets of a grammar.
Program11.l	Counts words and lines in a file.
Program12.y	Yacc calculator (addition and multiplication).
Program13/	Yacc + Lex calculator (separate files).
Program14/	Yacc + Lex parser for arithmetic expressions.
Program15.c	Lexical analyzer in C for identifying tokens.
Program16.c	Computes FOLLOW sets of a grammar.
Program17.c	Simulates stack allocation for function calls.

🧾 2. Assignment-Programs

Extra Lex programs for practice.

Program	Description
Program1.l	Recognizes identifiers.
Program2.l	Recognizes real number formats.
